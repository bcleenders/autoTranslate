\section{Introduction}
Since the introduction of word2vec~\cite{mikolov2013efficient, mikolov2013distributed}, blah blah

\subsection{Problem Statement}
The project will investigate how to...

\subsection{Prior Work}
Mention (at least)~\cite{levy2014linguistic, mikolov2013exploiting, wolf2014joint}

Describe both the broader spectrum of word2vec/NLP \textbf{and} machine translation. Position our research (i.e. we skip grammar), and be sure to limit our project to per-word translation (not full grammatically correct sentences).

\subsection{Goals}
Pretty much what our deliverables are...

\subsection{Tasks}
What do we have to do to achieve this?

\begin{itemize}
  \item Build (at least) two working setups for automated translation
  \item Make a verification mechanism
  \item Verify which setup works better
\end{itemize}

\section{Planning}
A global overview of the milestones we defined in our research is as follows;
\begin{description}
  \item \emph{Half September - October: Literary Study)}\\
    During this phase, a list of relevant papers (e.g. \cite{levy2014linguistic, mikolov2013exploiting, wolf2014joint}) is collected, short-listed to a readable size and read. Each paper will get a brief (informal) summarization to capture the essence of the paper insofar as it is relevant to this research. These summaries help process the information and provide quick access during the practical research.\\

    Not all papers relevant to the research will be read during this phase, so next phases will include a fair share of reading.
  \item \emph{October: Preparing experiments}\\
    Description
  \item \emph{November: Running experiments}\\
    Description
  \item \emph{Before 12 December: Incorporating results in paper}\\
    During this phase, we will incorporate the results obtained in the experiments into our final paper.
\end{description}

\section{Allocation of Responsibilities}
Marc pledges to provide sufficient beer. Bram will take care of coffee and possibly some Club-Mat√©.
