\subsection{Improvements}
\begin{itemize}
\item Use labelled data (e.g. nl\_koning, en\_king). Optionally: use words that are the same (computer, Amsterdam, wc) to get "free" training data. One can suppose these are likely to be translations.
\item Use word2phrase to combine "San Fransisco" into a single word.
\item Handle ambiguous translations better (i.e. "bank" in Dutch can be either "couch" or "bank" in English). More research can be done in the exact implementation for this.
\end{itemize}
